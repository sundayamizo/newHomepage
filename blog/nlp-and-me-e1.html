I have been working as a undergrad researcher on the topic of&nbsp; "Natural Language Processing" for like one year now, and I haven't write any details about it!<br />
<br />
I made <a href="http://www.sundayamizo.ga/2016/03/mizo-fying-internet.html" target="_blank">a post</a> about some introduction to Mizo language processing. I mainly focus on Machine Translation only, and that is also very basic introduction! So, I'd like to share a few things that I knew about Natural Language Processing. I will make post about NLP&nbsp; in series , because NLP is a very vast field and consist of many sub-topics.<br />
<br />
It will not be like a lecture or instruction, but merely my opinions and my ideas. Some of it may be wrong, may not be applicable in NLP. But still, I'd like to share my opinions!<br />
<br />
Me and my colleagues are working on Information Retrieval for Indian Languages, mainly Mizo language! Our research paper haven't published yet, so I will speak later.<br />
<br />
Last winter vacation i.e December 2015 to January 2016, we are working on Mizo Parts of Speech Tagging, which is the first time for Mizo language. We have also created Mizo POS Tagger, which will soon be available to download for public!<br />
<br />
Mizo language, in particular, have lots of ambiguity! Sometimes working on it makes me feel very dizzy! But, as I am working with a great programmer and a brilliant mind, we are able to overcome most of&nbsp; the ambiguities!<br />
<br />
Part of Speech Tagging for Mizo somehow requires a good knowloedge of grammar! Since POST is one of the very important piece of NLP, there no other option other than to solve the ambiguities.<br />
<br />
If you may wonder what's the neccessities of it, you can see one application called <a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu:8080/parser/" target="_blank">Stanford Parser</a>. Each word in a sentence is a part of&nbsp; part of speech!<br />
<br />
Consider a sentence:<br />
<br />
<code>Jeremy is a good programmer living in India</code><br />
<br />
If you parse it in Stanford Parser, you will find the POS tagging result as:<br />
<br />
<code>
</code>
<br />
<div class="parserOutputMonospace">
<div style="float: left; padding-right: 1em; white-space: nowrap;">
<code>Jeremy/NNP</code></div>
<div style="float: left; padding-right: 1em; white-space: nowrap;">
<code>is/VBZ</code></div>
<div style="float: left; padding-right: 1em; white-space: nowrap;">
<code>a/DT</code></div>
<div style="float: left; padding-right: 1em; white-space: nowrap;">
<code>good/JJ</code></div>
<div style="float: left; padding-right: 1em; white-space: nowrap;">
<code>programmer/NN</code></div>
<div style="float: left; padding-right: 1em; white-space: nowrap;">
<code>living/VBG</code></div>
<div style="float: left; padding-right: 1em; white-space: nowrap;">
<code>in/IN</code></div>
<div style="float: left; padding-right: 1em; white-space: nowrap;">
<code>India/NNP</code></div>
<div style="float: left; padding-right: 1em; white-space: nowrap;">
</div>
<div style="float: left; padding-right: 1em; white-space: nowrap;">
</div>
<div style="float: left; padding-right: 1em; white-space: nowrap;">
</div>
</div>
<br />
<br />
<code>NNP</code>,<code> NN</code>, <code>VBG</code>,<code> VBZ</code>,<code> JJ</code>,<code> DT</code>, etc. are the part of speech tags! Different language will have different POS tags as the part of speech for different language is different!<br />
<br />
If you wanna read more about Part of Speech tagging, you could find more about it in Wikipedia.<br />
Like I said, I don't have a deep knowledge about POS tagging, I better not talk much about it!<br />
<br />
One thing I knew about NLP is that, before we let our machine do work on its own, we have to do it for them manually!<br />
Our POS tagger is also one such application which will be used to tag a POS manually! Once we finished all the documentation , I will share it for download! May be someday it will be one important tool for future researchers of Mizo NLP! </div>
