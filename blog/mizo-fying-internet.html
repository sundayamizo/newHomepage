<i class="fa fa-quote-left fa-3x fa-pull-left fa-border"></i>If you have used the internet , not only facebook or other
social networks, I hope you have used or heard of the word "Google
Translate" ! Google Translate is a online tool/service which is used to
translate one language to another language! Other such services are also
 available like <a href="http://babelfish.com/?ref=sundayamizo.in" target="">Babelfish.com</a>&nbsp; and many more. The most efficient and most accurate one will be what we call <a href="http://translate.google.com/" target="">Google Translate</a> which, currently, have about 90 different languages!<br />

Through this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_translation" target="">Machine Translation</a>&nbsp; system , I personally believed that, we can make the world again as it used to be during the time of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Babel" target="">Babel</a>
 !&nbsp; We can make the world a more open place and a real global village.
As we know, social networking websites like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram
 and many more, they make a more open place for connectivity all over
the world. But, the medium of conversation i.e. the language is still
different. Although we have English as the International language , not
everyone can speak or understand English!&nbsp; <br />
<br />
We all wanted to
save our own language from extinction, especially the Mizo's. I am
currently working on this topic of "Nature Language Processing in Mizo"
under the guidance of <a href="http://parthapakray.com/?ref=sundayamizo.in" target="">Dr. Partha Pakray</a>&nbsp;
 and Mr. Gautam Majumder. I am very excited and very grateful that they
give an interest in Mizo language processing which is a tough thing for
them as they have a very little knowledge about Mizo. I praised them for
 taking steps on such thing while no Mizo people haven't work yet! <br />
This is a very big challenge for me and I am giving my best effort on it!<br />
<br />
Creating
 a translation system for Mizo language, specially for the Internet
(which I call Mizo-fying the Internet) have always been on my mind since
 my childhood days! Now, I got the chance!! <br />
But, I do not
have a deep knowledge of the Mizo language and also that a very good
knowledge of English is also very much required at which I am very poor!<br />
<br />
<i>Mizo tawng hi tun dinhmun ah chuan a boral hlauhawm chu a
 ni hauh lo, chu mi tichiang tur chuan tawng dang nen a leh tawn zung
zung theihna hi kan neih ve ngei hi ka duh em em a ni. Tunlai khawvel
changkan zelna ah hian kan hnam nunphung leh ziarang hrang hrang te, kan
 tawng te hi khawvel mit hmuh a kan pholan ve a, kan Mizo khawvel hi kan
 tih zauh zel hi ka duh tak meuh meuh a ni.&nbsp;</i><br />
<br />
This is an
ongoing project and I will try to give a short report on what we have
done here on my blog. If anyone is interested, you can contact our
Leader Dr. Partha Pakray , Head of Department , Dept. of Computer
Science &amp; Engg., <a href="http://nitmz.ac.in/" target="">NIT Mizoram</a> .<br />
<br />
We would very much appreciate Mizo Lecturers or Teachers who have a deep knowledge in Mizo language. <br />
Come on. Let's Mizo-fy the Internet!<br />
