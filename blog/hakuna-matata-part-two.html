My life is based on a simple Swahili saying "<b>Hakuna Matata</b>" !<br />
<br />
If you have seen a Disney animated movie "<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110357/" target="_blank"><b>The Lion King</b></a>" , I believe that you have heard of this quote! Yes! My life relied on that thing, and its f**king good!<br />
<br />
I have also wrote a <a href="http://www.sundayamizo.ga/2013/12/hakuna-matata.html" target="_blank">post about Hakuna Matata</a> in Mizo, but it does not really point out what I'm trying to say! Besides, I wrote it in Mizo! So, I want to share what really comes to my mind when I say <i>Hakuna Matata</i>! So, this is HAKUNA MATATA - PART TWO!!!<br />
<br />
As the eldest boy of a poor family, I'm always worried about my future, my family's future, who will I become, how will I stand up for my family! I am truly worried by these things! If you don't <a href="http://www.sundayamizo.ga/2016/04/in-their-shoes.html" target="_blank">stand on my shoes</a>, you will not really understand it! Life was really hard to enjoy! My conscience often stop me from enjoying life to the fullest! '<i>If you don't study well...</i>.', '<i>If I did this</i>...' , '<i>If I didn't do this</i>....' .... blah blah blah... ! I was scared by everything thing that could be enjoyed!<br />
<br />
But at some point in my life, this thing changed! I don't know when, how and who did!<br />
<br />
Following what my heart really wants me to do is often&nbsp; (<i>I wouldn't say <b>'always'</b></i>)&nbsp; a good decision! As an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institutes_of_Technology" target="_blank">NITian,&nbsp; </a>a lot of stuffs and works is needed to be done! If I am what I used to be before, I may like to commit suicide also!!! But now, as I said '<i>Hakuna Matata</i>' to everything or problems that comes before me, you can 100% trust me to not commit a suicide! :D LOL!!!<br />
<br />
You know, I said that following what my heart wants me to do is often a good decision, its true! When I follow a path as a result of being afraid of the other path (which I actually wants to follow), I never end up so good!<br />
<br />
What's the purpose of being an Engineer or Doctor or any highly paid person if you didn't enjoy your life? What's the purpose of life? What of the meaning of life without freedom? I would rather let myself cut into pieces than to live under someone's order!<br />
<br />
Yes, money can sometimes buy you an hour of happiness! But know that there often comes a time when all money in the world can't buy you a second of happiness! Imagine yourself on a sinking ship full of treasures!<br />
<br />
Worrying about a thing seldom solves a problem! The richest are not the happiest! Freedom! These three things are the most important basis in my life!<br />
<br />
I always look for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bare_Necessities" target="_blank">Bare Necessities of Life</a>!<br />
