After I passed class 12, I have no idea where I am going! I just live my life as it is! I have no further plan for my future! My Dad told me to buy a mobile phone for myself with the money I received from the school!<br />
<br />
<div class="specs-phone-name-title" style="text-align: left;">
As he allow to buy a phone for myself, I am very excited and happy! I bought my first ever mobile phone on 23rd June 2013! It was <span style="font-weight: normal;"><a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_rex_90_s5292-5301.php" target="_blank">Samsung Rex 90 S5292 </a>! I was crazy for it and even though it wasn't a smart phone I used it very smartly! The only thing that I need at that time was Internet! I used <a href="http://www.opera.com/mobile/mini" target="_blank">Opera Mini</a> browser for Java and browse the internet freely! I am very happy with it!&nbsp;</span></div>
<div class="specs-phone-name-title" style="text-align: left;">
<span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span></div>
<div class="specs-phone-name-title" style="text-align: left;">
<span style="font-weight: normal;">One week after I bought my phone, I come to know that some <a href="http://fb.me/LHWrenthley" target="_blank">Mizo guy</a> built a mobile website for sharing and downloading Mizo songs! <a href="http://zoland.in/" target="_blank">ZoLand</a> was becoming very popular as there's no website for sharing and downloading Mizo songs at that time! I accidentally visit some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_404" target="_blank">404 page</a> and come to know that they are creating a wapsite /website on <a href="http://wapka.mobi/" target="_blank">Wapka&nbsp;&nbsp; </a>. Some curiosity in me made me create an account on Wapka and I slowly come to learn things !&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div>

<div class="specs-phone-name-title" style="text-align: left;">
<span style="font-weight: normal;">My first website was zophysics.wapka.mobi </span>which I created on 25.07.2013. I set some bg-color and put some text and some image! But, I have removed them (don't know why!). It was just 2 and half years back , but things change so fast! I have created dozens on site on wapka , but I am not too much interested in it!&nbsp;</div>
<div class="specs-phone-name-title" style="text-align: left;">
<br />
After one month of staying on Wapka, I heard some other mobile web development platform, called <a href="http://xtgem.com/" target="_blank">XtGem</a>! I moved to XtGem and I become very interested in it! To study CSS, Javascript and HTML , it was the best even from my phone!</div>
<div class="specs-phone-name-title" style="text-align: left;">
<br /></div>
<div class="specs-phone-name-title" style="text-align: left;">
I started studying basic CSS and HTML as I have no knowledge before! I used <a href="http://w3schools.com/" target="_blank">W3Schools</a> study HTML and CSS . I note down new things I learnt on a notebook and it helps me very much!&nbsp;</div>
<div class="specs-phone-name-title" style="text-align: left;">
<br /></div>
<div class="specs-phone-name-title" style="text-align: left;">
After 3 months of studying web basic from my REX 90, I decided that I have to change my phone for better study as my phone have so many problems! So, I sold it and buy <a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/gionee_pioneer_p2-6091.php" target="_blank">GIONEE P2 </a>&nbsp; and it was so perfect for me!&nbsp;</div>
<div class="specs-phone-name-title" style="text-align: left;">
<br /></div>
<div class="specs-phone-name-title" style="text-align: left;">
After 2 months of hard working and many sleepless nights, I can finished my first proper website which I called Genesis Chamber, a dowloads site -cum- my blog - cum - Gallery!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
Facebook was becoming popular among most Mizo people in 2012-13.&nbsp; That was the time I started having my mobile phone and become in touch with my phone every time! My relatives always scold me thinking that I was going online on Facebook and doing nonsense thing! But actually, I am studying and start a way for my future! They wouldn't believe me if I say!!! :D :D !!! My eyes suffer very much because of that thing , but never regret! <br />
<br />
<br />
I never publish my website Genesis Chamber for almost a year and I improved it day by day! As I am preparing for JEE exam , I couldn't give much time to it and almost forget about it! And on October 7th , 2014 , I started publishing my website in memory of my beloved mother K.Lalngaihawmi , who died on 7th October 2011. I gain many visitors at the time of publishing and I was the only one who created a proper downloads site in XtGem ! It was a little bit tougher than Wapka and there's no proper tutorials on it!<br />
<br />

<br />
After 2 months of publishing, many other Mizo webmaster approaches me to give them a tutorial on it. I reject 2-3 persons, but as more and more come to me requesting tutorials, I thought of creating a tutorial on it! So, I started writing and on December 2014, I published LushaiWeb ! <br />
<br />
<br />
As I own a laptop and get some internet connection, I quit mobile (wap) web development and started learning to develop a Desktop friendly websites! As I started learing C and C++ programming language on my regular course, I plan to study PHP and some other web development languages on my own! And now, I have done something for my college and some company!<br />
<br />
<br />
What I wanted to say is that, if I didn't started way back in 2013 i.e when I have only&nbsp; a very poor device and poor internet connection, I wouldn't reached this position I reached today! <br />
<br />
<br />
My love for internet and computers destroyed my dream to become a Physicists! But I will never let myself down! I will use the very same thing (internet and computers) to make a name for myself!<br />
<br />
<br />
That is the reason why I say, <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "<i>Eng thil pawh i nun tichhe khawp a i atchilh chuan, i nun siam tha leh turin fing takin luh chilh law law rawh</i>"</div>
