This very night also happens the same thing! I have mid-semester exam tomorrow and lots of extra work to do! (<i>You may wonder how come I have time to write this post! But read on!</i>)<br />
<br />
I contact a father of one of my friend who work in P&amp;E Dept and ask him when will we be having power supply and why we still do not have the whole day! He told me that there was some line fault due to the heavy rain and they're expecting to get it back to work soon!<br />
<br />
As I told all my problem and told him that I am very worried with all the tasks I have to do, he start laughing and told me that "<i>Kawlphetha awm lo hi chuan kan awm thei tawh lo chu a nih hi maw...!</i>" , which simply means that we surely cannot live without power supply! He explains why he said that in this way: <i>I will translate in English!</i><br />
<br />
<i class="fa fa-quote-left fa-3x fa-pull-left fa-border"></i><i>Just before you call me, one man also calls me! He was having similar problem with you but the case was a little bit more serious than yours! He was facing one of the most important interview for his career in his life and it was going to be online! He had to do it tonight and there's no second chance! But as the power supply was not there and no inverter or generator , he was very worried as the time was coming very near! If he fail to do this, he lost his valuable chance! But there's nothing much I can do for him as the error couldn't be fix in just a minute! So I told him that we are going to make it work soon!</i> <i>"</i><br />

After I heard him say, so many things fly around my brain and my heart :D ! After putting myself in that person's shoes or <i>chappal </i>or whatever, how worried am I going to be? If you consider yourself as losing your biggest opportunities in your life , how will you feel?<br />
<br />
The effect of no power supply can destroy a man's life! It can make you fail your exam! It can make you feel lonely<i> </i>:D !<i> </i>In the mean time can be a good time for robbers and <i>ramhuai</i>!<br />
<br />
Not only 'no current' case , other cases like 'traffic jam' many life can be destroyed!<br />
<br />
Due to traffic jam , one's career can be destroyed! A seriously ill person who could be saved if he reach in time can lose his chance of continuing his life! A girl who is going to get married in 5 minutes can not reach her place! (<i>as seen in Vai film</i>)!&nbsp; A student can get a nice stick on his face as he cannot reach the class in the proper time (me got one too! ) :D !<br />

If you think and put yourself in others' shoes, you will understand why there must be a very vast understanding in everything! We should understand each others problem to prevent this world from being a harsh world to live in!<br />
<br />
I would not add much about this thing! Its not because I have less thing to say, but because I know that when I wrote long post... myself hate them to read it and feel bored!<br />
<br />
So, I will start my study and publish this post at 1:45 am , i.e on 1st April , 2016 !<br />
Oh Gosh! Its April Fool! Just realized it as I wrote! <br />
