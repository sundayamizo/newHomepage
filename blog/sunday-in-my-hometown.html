Judging from my lifestyle as you've seen me , you probably can know that I am not coming from a very big town! Well , its true! My hometown Bilkhawthir is a small town ( but not to say small town for a state like Mizoram) in Kolasib District, Northern Mizoram. It lies 100KM away from Aizawl, and around 50KM from Mizoram-Assam Border. I don't know much to talk about the Geographical conditions!<br />
<br />
As I've said, it is not a big town and there nothing much to talk about of it for outsiders! But, for the people of Bilkhawthlir, it is the only place where they feel free, the only place where they can sleep peacefully, the only "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canaan" target="_blank">Canaan</a>" in this world and&nbsp; the only place where they belong on this whole Earth! So, as a proud villager of Zoram Kanaan (Canaan of Mizoram, as Prophet Chawngkhupa said ), I also have so many things to share with you about this blessed land! It may not worth reading 'cause I do not have much experience here as I live in Aizawl from 2006 ! But, I go HOME frequently to have some wonderful experiences! So, I'd like to share some!<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<b>SUNDAY , The first day in a week:</b><br />
&nbsp;99% of the villagers are Christian by religion! So, most of the villagers go to church on this day. Everyone's busy this morning! Moms cook food for breakfast, Dads goes out to visit neighbor and&nbsp; some member of the Church sub-committees visit each house. When you turn on the TV you can hear a choir singing a good Gospel song, praising The Lord! Most family eats breakfast at 08:30am this morning, and the breakfast is likely to include a cooked Pork with some mustard leaves! After the heavy breakfast (breakfast and dinner is usually heavy in Mizo society), we'll all dressed up for the Church service, wearing our Sunday's Best!<br />
<br />
The Church bell usually rings at 09:30am in the morning and the service often start at 10:00am. I will not say much about the Church Service, as it differs from different denominations!<br />
<br />
Most of the church service will end at 11:00 - 12:00 , and there may be some Follow-up programmes like KṬP (a Young Christians Association of Presbyterian Church), and some more! After all the services ,&nbsp; we usually have a cup of tea and some cakes/biscuits (at our own home!) and the afternoon session starts at 1:30pm, which usually ends at 2:30pm. Frankly speaking,&nbsp; it is quite boring to attend to church services all day!<br />
<br />
For kids, Sunday afternoon is a very good day for what we call "inkahlem", or "inṭhengkah" , a game where we play a war with our guns and pistols! I always remember the days when we think of nothing, caring nothing much! All I knew was that I have my Parent always standing beside me, they provide us anything that we NEED (not all we WANT), they are like God to us, we have our friends with whom we can play, I got my toys and also got happiness! What will I need more?<br />
<br />
Dinner's usually at 5pm and we still got night time Church service, which usually start at 6:30-7pm , depending on the season! The service lasts around one or one and half hour. Usually, for a normal people (!) , Sunday night, usually,is not a very BIG NIGHT!<br />
<br />
So, like that , we usually end up a Sunday. If used well, it ends well!<br />
<br />
As a Christian, we spend 70% of the day &nbsp;at Church, worshiped The Lord!<br />
<br />
<b>n.b: </b>When I wrote this post, may be around March 2016, I thought of writing how we normally spend the whole week in one post! But, it is going to be very long. I kept in a draft for about 3 months, and tonight when I saw that draft I change my mind and plan to write a day per post! So, I change my post title &nbsp;from A WEEK IN MY HOMETOWN to SUNDAY IN MY HOMETOWN! I will soon write a new post on MONDAY IN MY HOMETOWN. <br />
