    <p>Here I write briefly about what I am passionate about! The first does not mean greater interest! :) </p>
    <h3>Music</h3>
    <p style="text-align:justify">
      I love music! Right from the beginning, <b>Country Music</b> fits my life. It always best describes my feelings! If you see my playlists, be it my phone, my laptop, YouTube,etc., I can guarantee you that 80% of 'em are Country Music.<br/> Other than that, you may also find - Alternative Rock, Hindi Songs and Some Mizo Songs. I do listen to lots of Gospel songs. I can play a guitar, but only well to play what I like to sing (I don't sing difficult songs :) )! I'll try to share my palylist sometime.
    </p>
    <h3>Movies</h3>
    <p style="text-align:justify">
      I watch lots of Movies. Even though I like most genres, I watch more Comedy, Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi, Biography, Animation and Fantasy. Movies gave me so much inspirations to me!<br/>
      And yes... I learn many of my English words from movies! LOL!
    </p>
    <h3>Art</h3>
    <p style="text-align:justify">
      When I say ART, I mostly mean Paintings and Drawings. Every child wanted to be a good artist. So, as a child, I also wanted to be a great painter. I spend most of my night free time drawing some Comics characters. In my high school years, I have won a prize in a School Painting Competition. Till today, I spent my free time sketching my feelings with a pen or pencil. :)
    </p>
    <h3>Sports</h3>
    <p style="text-align:justify">
      Honestly, I am not a sport-person. I don't often do sport. But, I play Football, Cricket,etc. for fun. Though I did not play a lot, I WATCH them a lot! :) ! I am a TRUE fan of <b>Chelsea Football Club</b>!
    </p>
    <h3>Reading</h3>
    <p style="text-align:justify">
      The reason why I put on this ugly spectacles is because of my reading habit. I read a lot since 9 years old. I love adventure fictions. I also read biographies, personality development. But now, as I have more work, I couldn't spare more time to reading books!
    </p>
    <h3>Programming</h3>
      <p style="text-align:justify">
        I should say I'm one of the worst student in Programming when I first attended my programming course in 2014. But, I like it and I never give up on it! Now, I can easily understand any programming language in a short period. I love solvinf real-life problems more than competitive problems.
      </p>
    <h3>Research</h3>
    <p style="text-align:justify">
      I was  introduced to the methodology of Research in 2015. From that time, I love doing research, working on a real life problems. Right now, I am a web security researcher and am about to publish some papers.
